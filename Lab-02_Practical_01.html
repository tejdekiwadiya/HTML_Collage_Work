    <p style="background-color:purple; color:azure; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size: 0.4cm;">Hadn’t I just told
        myself to clear the <b><i>damn</b></i> cookies and the
        history on my computer? <b><i>Yeah</b></i>, I had. I knew I had. It had just
        been a few weeks ago when the last article had <i><b>popped</b></i> up on
        my home page, and it had ended up <b>forcing</b> me to <b><i>jump</b></i> on a
        stationary bike so that I <b><i>wouldn’t</b></i> do something stupid.
    </p>

    <p style="background-color:forestgreen; color:wheat; font-family:'Freestyle Script';">Except that time, all I had
        done was give my screen the
        middle finger and then clicked on a <i><b>different</b></i> article to read…
        cussing under my breath the whole time</p>

    <p style="background-color:aqua; color:black; font-family:'Gabriola';"><b><i>Unfortunately </i></b>for me, I was
        <b><i>grumpy, petty, and a little
                bored,</i></b> and that’s why I followed the link for the first time in a
        <b><i>while</i></b>, watching my computer screen blink for a second before
        it led me to a website that in the past I had been on more times
        than I would ever be willing to admit.

    <p style="background-color:yellow; color:black; font-family:'Harrington';">Months ago. A year ago. Not
        <b><i>lately</i></b>. Not in a long time.</p>
